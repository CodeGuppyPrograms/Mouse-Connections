Run it to see why the dilema!

The program is a variation on the [Mutual connections](tutorial://mutual_connections) graphic effect also present on CodeGuppy.

A series of balls are bouncing from the edges of the canvas. Connections are created on the fly from the mouse cursor to each ball that is in a certain range from the cursor.
